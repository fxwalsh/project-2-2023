### Add a Device

+ Select the **â€œDevices"** tab at the top of the Arduino IoT Cloud interface to manage and add new devices.  You will need to have the [Arduino Agent installed](https://create.arduino.cc/getting-started/plugin/welcome). You will be prompted to do this.
+ Click the "ADD" button and follow the instructions to add your Arduino board.

## Programming the Device - Blink Again!

Select the "Sketch" Tab. It will have some auto generated code in it based on your configuration so far. Notice it has the same structure as the code used in previous labs, with a setup() and loop() function.

+ Add the following statement at the end of the setup() function to configure digital pin 9 for output 

  ~~~c++
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  ~~~

+ Add the following code to the loop() function just under the ""//your code here" comment. If it's wired correctly, you should see it blink every second. 

+ ~~~c++
    digitalWrite(9, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(9,LOW);
    delay(1000);
  ~~~

+ Upload the code to the device. If it's wired correctly, you should see it blink every second.
