# Introduction 

In this lab you will control an RGB Led from the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard



You will:

+ Learn how an RGB LED works

+ Connect an RGB LED to an Arduino

+ Write a program that controls the colour of the RGB

### Equipment:

+ Arduino MKR IoT Bundle

## RGB LED Operation

RGB LEDs can emit any colour by combining the three basic colour, red, blue, and green. It does this by combining three separate LEDs (red, green,blue) in a single device. By controlling the brightness of each LED (using pulse width modulation), we can select the colour of the LED.

(NOTE: the RGB LED in this diagram is Common Cathode(connected to ground). Your LED could be Common Anode (connected to power line) )


Each colour value (R G and B)is represented by a range from 0 - 255. How many different colours are possible? 

The PRG LED is controlled using **Pulse Width Modulation**  . The R G and B pins are connected to PWM signals and the duty cycle for each corresponds to  the colour values.
