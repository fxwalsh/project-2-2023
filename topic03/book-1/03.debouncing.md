# Debouncing

In electronics, debouncing is a technique used to eliminate rapid, repetitive changes in a signal. This is typically done to filter out "bouncing" or oscillating signals that are generated when a switch or button is pressed. When a switch is pressed, it may bounce several times before finally settling in the closed or open position. Debouncing ensures that only one transition is registered, avoiding multiple transitions that could cause incorrect operation of the circuit.

Debouncing can be achieved in a variety of ways, including using a simple RC circuit, **or software in a microcontroller.** The goal of debouncing is to ensure that the output of the switch or button only changes state once, even if the input signal is bouncing.



## The Code

+ Add the following  variables at the top of the program

~~~c++
unsigned long lastDebounceTime = 0;  // Timestamp for last button state change
unsigned long debounceDelay = 50;    // Debouncing delay in milliseconds


void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);  // Read the button state
  if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {  // Check if the button state has changed
    lastDebounceTime = millis();         // Store the time of the change
  }
  if ((millis() - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) {  // Check if enough time has passed
    if (buttonState != buttonState) {    // Check if the button state has stabilized
      Serial,println("Button State Changed")
    }
  }
  lastButtonState = buttonState;         // Store the current button state as the last button state
}

+ Update the loop() function by adding in the highlighted code statement
