# Edge Detection

In the last step you used a simple button to calculate and output a random number. 
In this step, we will improve this functionality by getting it to calculate a number just when a "change" is detected in the button pin. This happens when the button is pressed (goes from LOW to HIGH) and when it is released (goes from HIGH to LOW). This is also know as **edge detection**.

+ We need variables to track both the current and last button state. Add the following variable at the top of the program:

~~~c
int lastButtonState = LOW;
~~~

+ Replace the entire contents of the Loop() function with the following:

~~~c
    // read the state of the pushbutton value
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
   // check if button state has changed (pressed or let go)
   if (buttonState != lastButtonState) {
    if (buttonState == HIGH) {
      // if the current state is HIGH, then the button
      // went from off to on
        // display a random number between 0-9
    	int randomNumber=random(0,10);
    	digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    	Serial.println(randomNumber);
    } else {
      // if the current state is LOW, then the button
      // went from on to off
      	Serial.println("off");
      	digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    }
  }
  // save the current state as the last state, for
  // the next time through the loop
  lastButtonState = buttonState;

~~~

The above code uses the ``currentState`` and ``lastState`` variables to check if the button "state" has changed. If it has moved from LOW->HIGH then it outputs the random number.

+ Run the code again and check the output ion the serial console:

![Serial Monitor](C:\Users\Frank\Desktop\repos\2023\project-2\topic03\sevenseglab\img\12.png)

You will notice that a random number changes when you press the button and not when you leave go.
