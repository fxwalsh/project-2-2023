# Get Git

#### Windows OS / Mac
If you're on Windows, download the  **GitHub Desktop**, from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) which includes Git, and use the Git Shell for your terminal.

#### Linux

You can use the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution. For Fedora use:

``$ sudo yum install git-all``

For Debian-based distributions use:

``$ sudo apt-get install git-all``
